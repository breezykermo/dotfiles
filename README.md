# [my](https://lachlankermode.com) dotfiles

Initially inspired/grafted from
[jessfraz/dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles), and then updated by
way of [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz) and the [associated
dotfiles](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice).

About the same as [Luke Rice's
setup](https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/f6b78db7-b368-4647-bc64-28c08fff1988),
but with [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as the default shell and [my vim setup](https://github.com/breezykermo/.vim).

# Install 
1. Run the LARBS install script with dotfiles pointing to this repo, and the
   package list to 'progs.csv' at the root level here.
2. Git clone [my vim setup](https://github.com/breezykermo/.vim) into .vim.
3. Reboot? Not sure.
