# dotfiles

heavily inspired/grafted from [jessfraz/dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles).

see [breezykermo/.vim](https://github.com/breezykermo/.vim) for vim config.
This should work with both vim and nvim.

I typically use a [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) enhanced with
[starship](https://github.com/starship/starship).


# setup
```
ln -sf .config/starship.toml $HOME/.config/starship.toml
```
