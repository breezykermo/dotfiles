# dotfiles

initially inspired/grafted from
[jessfraz/dotfiles](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles), and then updated by
way of [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz) and the [associated
dotfiles](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice).

See [breezykermo/.vim](https://github.com/breezykermo/.vim) for vim config
(assumed to exist at `~/.vim` in these dotfiles).

# setup
Run the LARBS install script with dotfiles pointing to this repo, and the
package list to 'progs.csv' at the root level here.
